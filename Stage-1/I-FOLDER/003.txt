<person>Hewitt</person> decries 'career sexism'

<person>Patricia Hewitt</person> said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an "increasingly high priority" and a "shared goal across government". Ms <person>Hewitt</person> was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: "Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. "We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that". Ms <person>Hewitt</person> also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential.
