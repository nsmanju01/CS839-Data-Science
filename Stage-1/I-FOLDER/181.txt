School sport 'is back', says PM

<person>Tony Blair</person> has promised that "sport is back" as a priority for schools.

The prime minister launched a Â£500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. "It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health," Mr <person>Blair</person> said. But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.

The latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options. Launching the initiative, Mr <person>Blair</person> completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London.

Earlier, Education Secretary <person>Charles Clarke</person> told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed "a coherent framework" and "dedicated funding". 

But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. Shadow spokesman for sport <person>Hugh Robertson</person> said: "I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer." He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an "anti-competitive sport agenda" had been pursued in recent years. <person>Martin Ward</person>, of the Secondary Heads Association, said members did not like "ring-fenced funds" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.
